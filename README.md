Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio | Python | Linux | SQL | Threat Modeling | Incident Response

**Welcome to my Cybersecurity portfolio!**

I'm a passionate and aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in core security concepts. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Analyst program, gaining valuable knowledge in various areas:

* **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Explored the history and significance of cybersecurity, understanding its role in protecting organizations.
* **Security Frameworks & Controls:** Learned how frameworks and controls are used to manage security risks and protect business operations.
* **Network Security:** Gained knowledge of network vulnerabilities and strategies for securing networks.
* **Linux & SQL Fundamentals:** Developed foundational skills in using Linux command line and querying databases with SQL.
[Apply filters to SQL queries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hP0n5iAceG5jc34WEZ-_Pv3nw38eohp73fFsyawi9L8/edit?usp=drive_link) 
* **Threat Modeling & Incident Response:** Learned about threat actor mindsets, security controls, and the incident response lifecycle.
* **Python for Cybersecurity:**  Explored the Python programming language and its application in automating cybersecurity tasks. (Currently working on incorporating Python scripts!)

**In this repository, you'll find:**

* A brief overview of each completed Google Cybersecurity Analyst course and my key takeaways.
* Sample Python scripts demonstrating basic security automation functionalities (coming soon!).
* Network security diagrams illustrating secure network configurations (if applicable). 

**(As I gain experience, I plan to add)**

* Real-world cybersecurity projects (with permission) to showcase practical skills.
* Links to relevant cybersecurity resources or communities I engage with.

**Stay tuned as I continue to develop my expertise in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity!**
